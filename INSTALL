Basics :
--------

To compile the core or the plug-ins, just copy-paste these lines into a terminal (assuming you are in the main directory of the core/plug-ins) :

-------------------------------------------------
cmake CMakeLists.txt  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
sudo make install
-------------------------------------------------

Notes :
-------

Install the dock first, and then compile the plug-ins.

If you choose to install in another folder than /usr, you must specify the same prefix for both core and plug-ins (and specify this folder in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH).

<deprecated>
If your libcairo is compiled with glitz support (that is, with --enable-glitz option), you can benefit from glitz hardware acceleration in cairo-dock too.
Just add the -Denable-glitz option.
</deprecated>

Plug-ins are compiled all at once, but you can skip some of them. Unstable plug-ins are skipped by default, unless you add "-Denable-xxx=yes", where xxx is the name of the plug-in.
See the "Applets.stable" file in the "plug-ins" folder for an exhaustive list of stable applets (that are effectively integrated into the official package).

To build the Cairo-Dock documentation, use the generate-doc.sh script in the 'doc' directory of the core.

Thanks for using Cairo-Dock, hope you will enjoy it ! ^_^
