Basics :
--------

To compile the core or the plug-ins, just copy-paste these lines into a terminal (assuming you are in the main directory of the core/plug-ins) :

-------------------------------------------------
cmake CMakeLists.txt  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
sudo make install
-------------------------------------------------



Notes :
-------

Install the dock first, and then compile the plug-ins. For more details, have a look at this webpage: http://www.glx-dock.org/ww_page.php?p=By%20compiling&lang=en

If you choose to install in another folder than /usr, you must specify the same prefix for both core and plug-ins (and specify this folder in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH).

You can launch 'cmake' and 'make' commands from another directory, it's maybe cleaner: 
-------------------------------------------------
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
sudo make install
-------------------------------------------------

For 64bits (x86_64) architectures, the libraries are installed in a 'lib64' directory by default but it seems it can be a problem for some distributions (e.g.: ArchLinux). If you have a problem by launching Cairo-Dock, you can compile it (core and its plug-ins) with the flag "FORCE_NOT_LIB64":
    $ cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DFORCE_NOT_LIB64=yes
You can also force another prefix for this librairy directory with "LIB_SUFFIX" flag, e.g. for 'lib32' directory:
    $ cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DLIB_SUFFIX=32

<deprecated>
If your libcairo is compiled with glitz support (that is, with --enable-glitz option), you can benefit from glitz hardware acceleration in cairo-dock too.
Just add the -Denable-glitz option.
</deprecated>

Plug-ins are compiled all at once, but you can skip some of them. Unstable plug-ins are skipped by default, unless you add "-Denable-xxx=yes", where xxx is the name of the plug-in.
See the "Applets.stable" file in the "plug-ins" folder for an exhaustive list of stable applets (that are effectively integrated into the official package).

To build the Cairo-Dock documentation, use the generate-doc.sh script in the 'doc' directory of the core.

Thanks for using Cairo-Dock, hope you will enjoy it ! ^_^
